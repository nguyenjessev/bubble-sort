# Bubble Sort
This is a Ruby implementation of bubble sort

#### Parameters
(Array of numbers)

#### Returns
Array of numbers sorted ascending

## Problems
Given an array of numbers, use a bubble sorting algorithm to sort them ascending

## What I used
Iteration over an array, helper variables to determine when the array was sorted, and logic to improve performance by restricting the length of the array to iterate over

## What I learned
A basic bubble sorting algorithm and how to optimize it (due to the observation that the last N items in an array are always sorted after N passes through the array)
